# ProjectConnect - Fall 2020 Honours Project - Web Client
---

### Background

* ProjectConnect is a web-based project recommender system that serves as a space for people to network with and recruit people to work on various side projects. It allows individuals who have an interest in developing a side project, but need more expertise in other technologies or application domains, to find people with those skills that could be recruited to contribute to the side project.
* This repository contains the React JS web client built for the platform, which enables end users to access all functionality provided by ProjectConnect.
* This web client is dependent on the ProjectConnect API server, which can be found in a separate repository [here](https://github.com/alexbisaillion/project-connect-server).
* This project was developed as my computer science honours project under the supervision of Dr. Dave McKenney at Carleton University.

### Install/Launch

* To use the client, the API server must be set up. See the repository [here](https://github.com/alexbisaillion/project-connect-server) for details.
* To launch the client, first install all dependencies by running `npm install` in the root directory.
* The client can then be started by running `npm start`.
